			<Label class="mb-2" text="Whilst we don't want to discourage people from enjoying the game, no times submitted or XP gained will be permanent. Additionally, the game is only available in English, and anti-cheat hasn't been added yet, meaning you may come across glitched runs. This is to be expected, in fact we encourage you to try to break the game in whatever ways you can find! Just please make sure to let us know how you do in our Discord (links on the bottom left of this page) as well sending us any suggestions you might have." />
			<Label class="mb-4" text="All that being said, thanks for your interest, and we hope you enjoy the game!" />
