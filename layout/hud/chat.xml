<!--
	Purpose: hard-coded layout file for <MomHudChat />
	Having a RaisedChat MomentumChat and LoweredChat ToastContainer is mandatory

	For snippets, see chat.xml, as we set message panels inside the toast container into that context

	Upon opening the chat, the toast container will be hidden and the chat is shown, taking input focus (away from the game)
	Upon closing (with escape) it's switched around and focus is returned to where it was before

	We set "thinkwheninvisible" so messages disappear after their showtime even if the chat is kept open
